* **datasets** : SIGNS dataset, SIGNS dataset is a collection of 6 signs representing numbers from 0 to 5.

* **Convolution_model_Step_by_Step.ipynb** : In this notebook you will learn about Padding, strided, Pooling layer, forward propagation and back propagation.

* **Convolution_model_Application.ipynb** : In this notebook, we designed and trained a CNN model with Tensorflow. While creating the model, we will use what we learned from the notebook "Convolution_model_Step_by_Step.ipynb".
